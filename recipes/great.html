    <h2>My recipe to become Great.</h2>
<p>So this is my idea for becoming great. lets not dig too deep into the topic, just the common idea which is that to become  great at a particular thing.
    There are two ways that I know to become great, which are to keep on practing or to be unique. The first one is fairly straightforward, which is effective towards technical skills like arithmetic and the likes. 
    The latter, being unique, is more of an individualistic approach, an original idea, if you will. Being unique, is especially effective with artistry. This two ways, again, is my view on how to become great at something.
</p>
<p>You may have guessed  by now that I am trying the being unique approach. I try to break the convention, thinking outside of the box, if you will.</p>
